# bepo.vim

Simple key bindings for bépo keyboard layout in vim and neovim.


## Installation

Install using your favorite package manager.
For instance, using [Vim-Plug][], you can add
to your configuration the following line:

```vimscript
Plug 'AliaumeL/bepo.vim'
```

Alternatively, it suffices to copy the
[source code][source] of the plugin to the
configuration file of your [vim][] or [neovim][]
installation.

## Features

See the [source][] for the authoritative list
of features. The basic feature is the
remapping of keys in `normal mode` to make
sense in bépo keyboard layouts. For instance

- `«` maps to `<`
- `»` maps to `>`
- `HJKL` re ordered to be compatible with the layout `LJKH`.
